1.truffle init
2.create your contract inside contracts folder
3.make sure your pragma version is compatible with config.js
4.truffle compile
5.create deploy file in migrations folder (copy paste from 1_initial_migration.js)
6. uncomment development network inside config.js

7.GANACHE: truffle migrate -- ERROR RPC: because you need to have ganache open for it.
Initiate ganache, make sure ganache localhost number is matching with config.js port number
Generally ganache is 7545, and truffle is 8545. So, change truffle number to ganache.

8.DEVCHAIN: If you dont want ganache, then you can say "truffle develop"
Then a cmd will be waiting your command: "truffle migrate"
Then: let contractInstance = await HelloWorld.deployed()
Then: contractInstance.hello()
Then: contractInstance.setWord("pomelo")
Then: contractInstance.setWord("pomelo", {value: 10000})
Then: contractInstance.setWord("apple", {value: web3.utils.toWei("1", "ether")})
Then: contractInstance.getWord({from: accounts[2]}) //By default truffle chooses the first account. However, if you want to use second one, this is how it is done.

9.If you want to deploy a contract from another contract by using the parameter of first contract:
Go to deployment file:

const ConstructorContract = artifacts.require("ConstructorContract");
module.exports = function (deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(ConstructorContract, "pomelo").then( async () => {
		let instance = await ConstructorContract.deployed();
		let message = instance.message();
		return deployer.deploy(SecondContract, message)
	})
};


10.TESTING
1. Create a test file like in the example, Each contract block will require redeployment
2. After you finish test block, type truffle compile, truffle develop, truffle migrate and then truffle test

11.DEVELOPMENT NETWORK ACCOUNTS PRIVATE KEYS:
If you do not want to use your metamask private keys, then:
npx mnemonics
copy the password string
create a "secrets.json" file at the same level with config.js and put inside:
{
	"mnemonic": "worth where earn decline acid upgrade whip edge spell need junk mansion"
}

Then go to config.js and remove	const mnemonic line
Then add this instead(this line must be active): 
const mnemonic = require("./secrets.json").mnemonic;
Uncomment this line: const HDWalletProvider....
then install: npm install @truffle/hdwallet-provider

Then uncomment (CRTL+K+U) "ropsten" network area and name it as goerli
replace the node url with the one you have from ANKR RPC endpoints
