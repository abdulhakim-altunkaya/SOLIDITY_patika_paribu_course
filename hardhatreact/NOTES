üö©üö©üö© DOTENV and HARDHAT.CONFIG PART üö©üö©üö©

‚è©4) Make sure you are on Metamask Mumbai testnet (or Goerli testnet, whatever you choose)
and that you have test ether
‚è©5) create a .env file at the root of the folder and put inside code below. Be careful about 
template literals and quotes.
PRIVATE_KEY="....mymetamask account private key......"
PROVIDER_URL=`...the https endpoint from alchemy.....`


‚è©6) Get the private key of your metamask account and paste it above.
‚è©7) Then go to Alchemy website, create a profile, go to Dashboard, click on "create application",
then choose "Matic" and then "Mumbai". Then click to "create"
Then click on "keys" and copy your "https" enpoint and paste it above.

‚è©8) Add ".env" to your .gitignore file

‚è©9) Go to hardhat.config.js and put inside:

require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers");
require("dotenv").config();

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.1",
  networks: {
    matic: {
      url: process.env.PROVIDER_URL,
      accounts: [`0x${process.env.PRIVATE_KEY}`]
    }
  }
};


‚è©10) Make sure you contract and hardhat.config file use the same compiler version.



üö©üö©üö©  HARDHAT PART üö©üö©üö©


‚è©18) Make sure compiler versions are the same across ".sol" and "hardhat.config.js" files
‚è©19) Then configure deploy.js
async function main() {
  const Nusaybin = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("Nusaybin");
  const nusaybin = await Nusaybin.deploy();
  await nusaybin.deployed();
  console.log("nusaybin Contract is deployed to:", nusaybin.address);
}

‚è©20) npx hardhat compile

‚è©21) npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.js --network matic

‚è©22) copy contract address inside .env file:
CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "...contract address......"

‚è©26) npx hardhat flatten > flattened.sol

This will create a single contract file at the root of your folder. We need this single contract file
because for verification we need to upload all our code at once to polygon.etherscan.

Then open flattened.sol on code editor, and delete all "SPDX-..." lines because there are more many of these lines
and it causes error. Delete all of them and type only one at the top of flattened.sol:
//SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL3.0

‚è©30) Then copy all flattened.sol and go to polygon.etherscan, 
choose single file, then "gpl v3" and then click to "continue"

Then paste inside the box and click on "verify".

‚è©31) once your contract is verified, it will create an interface for you interact with your contract.

Go to "safeMint" function, paste your metamask account in address area
Then paste json file link in tokenUri area
and click to "write"

This will promt metamask and it will ask you to sign the transaction. Once you sign, it will take some time and your
metamask account will have the NFT token.

‚è©32) To check it, go to to "https://testnets.opensea.io/"
Make sure you are on your metamask account dashboard. 
There you should see your nft image.

‚è©33) You can also check nft on your metamask.
Go to metamask, click on "import tokens"
Then paste contract address.
Then wait 2 seconds for the name to appear.
Then enter "0" inside decimal place and click to "import".
You should see your NFT token.
